# Raw Idea

Based on the product roadmap, the v1.0 priorities are:
1. Ethernet Connectivity - Enable W5500 Ethernet via ATmega328P bridge
2. Network Failover - Automatic WiFi <-> Ethernet switching

This spec should cover the Ethernet connectivity and network failover features for the LoRaWAN gateway.
